# About Me
I'm a self-taught programmer, high school student, and YouTuber. I try to contribute to [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky), but usually fail spectacularly due to laziness. I enjoy Star Wars, chess, gaming, making memes, reading/writing science fiction lore, 3d modeling, and Photoshopping gigantic noses and other hilarious features onto movie characters.

## My Interests
- Game development/modding
- AI/algorithms
- Functional programming
- Compiler/interpreter design/development
- Chess engine programming
